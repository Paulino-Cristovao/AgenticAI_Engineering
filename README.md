# Agentic AI Engineering

This repository contains code and examples from the Agentic AI Engineering course, demonstrating how to build, orchestrate, and deploy AI agents using multiple language models.

## Overview

This project explores building AI systems that can:
- Orchestrate multiple LLMs (OpenAI/GPT-4 and Google's Gemini)
- Create conversational interfaces with Gradio
- Process and analyze documents (PDF, text)
- Maintain conversation context across multiple interactions

## Key Components

- **Orchestration**: Notebooks demonstrating how to coordinate multiple LLMs
- **Resource Handling**: PDF processing and information extraction
- **User Interfaces**: Gradio chat interfaces for interacting with AI models
- **Environment Management**: Secure API key handling with dotenv
